![Class Diagram](diagrams/class_diagram.png)
## Assumption
1. Time is static, i.e. the age of the person added won't change. 
2. A person can only be a family member of one household.
3. We are more likely to query for the eligible household members than adding family members. 
    - We will update the eligible members when a person is added rather than when `/grant_schemes/grant` endpoint is queried.
## Set up
1. Install Postgres. 
    - Link: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/
2. Install Python 3
    - Link: https://realpython.com/installing-python/ 
3. Install Pip
    - Link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ 
4. Install Flask and psycopg2-binary
    - ```
      pip install Flask psycopg2-binary
5. Clone this repository
6. Open psql terminal and login
7. Create a database for this repository
    - ```
      CREATE DATABASE tap_meteor;
8. Create a user with full access to the database
    - ```
      CREATE USER dev WITH PASSWORD 'password';
9. Grant the user all administrative access
    - ```
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tap_meteor TO dev;
10. Ensure that the database and user are created before quitting the terminal.
11. In the repository directory, export the username and password for the database
    - ```
      export DB_USERNAME="dev" && export DB_PASSWORD="password"
12. Next, run init_db.py
    - ```
      python init_db.py
    - The python script contains the database schema and sample inputs.
13. To run the Flask app, run
    - ```
      export FLASK_APP=./controller/index.py
      export FLASK_ENV=development
      flask run
